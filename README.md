Small capacitors are 100nF
Big electrolytic capacitors are 10uF
Amplifier used: SSM 2019
Amplifier gain function: G = 10k\ohm / R_G + 1; where R_G is the gain resistor.
For our purposes, we wanted gain of 1, therefore gain resistor not connected. On the attached diagram, see 665\ohm and 69.8\ohm resistors - we actually do NOT connect them.

V_B is the input ground to the device; it becomes disconected
V_A is the input signal

V_out is the output signal
GND is the output signal ground
